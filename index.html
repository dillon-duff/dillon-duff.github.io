        <p>I'm a sophomore Computer Science major at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology with a passion for science and 
            programming. I'm also a basketball player at Rose-Hulman and have recently become a fan of playing ultimate frisbee and frisbee golf.
             I'm from Fort Wayne, Indiana and attended Snider High-School 2016-2020. I have various hobbies that
            include flying/building drones, Rubik's cubes and 3D puzzles, fishing, moderate gaming, and my love for sports. I'm very
            interested in computer science and its applications to scientific research and design as well as its mathematical applications. I'm a very
            eager and open learner who loves a challenge, and I find great joy in problem solving, especially when it is something new.
